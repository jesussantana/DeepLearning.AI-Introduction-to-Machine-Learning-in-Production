        "\n",
        "In this lab, you will create, train, evaluate, and make predictions on a model using [Apache Beam](https://beam.apache.org/) and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/). In particular, you will train a model to predict the molecular energy based on the number of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen atoms.\n",
        "\n",
        "This lab is marked as optional because you will not be interacting with Beam-based systems directly in future exercises. Other courses of this specialization also use tools that abstract this layer. Nonetheless, it would be good to be familiar with it since it is used under the hood by TFX which is the main ML pipelines framework that you will use in other labs. Seeing how these systems work will let you explore other codebases that use this tool more freely and even make contributions or bug fixes as you see fit. If you don't know the basics of Beam yet, we encourage you to look at the [Minimal Word Count example here](https://beam.apache.org/get-started/wordcount-example/) for a quick start and use the [Beam Programming Guide](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/programming-guide) to look up concepts if needed.\n",

        " 4. Doing predictions\n",
        "\n",
        "You will focus particularly on Phase 2 (Preprocessing) and a bit of Phase 4 (Predictions) because these use Beam in its implementation.\n",
